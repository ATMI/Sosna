Collision avoidance in transportation refers to the prevention of potential vehicle impacts.
This is a broad field, ranging from advanced emergency braking systems in automobiles to space debris avoidance for spacecraft.

Aircraft collision avoidance is among highly relevant topics nowadays.
In 2023, NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System recorded around 300 commercial aircraft near-collisions in the US\@.
The growing number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is also a cause of concern.

This paper describes the environment and actor design for a reinforcement learning-based aircraft-aircraft collision avoidance system.
However, some techniques might be also used in aircraft-obstacle collision avoidance case studies.
We discuss possible implementation strategies, related concepts among with potential pitfalls, demonstrating some of them in practical experiments.
