Both agents are equipped with a variable thrust engine.
Their controls are similar to an aircraft ones and include yaw, pitch and roll.
The gravitation was not considered in our simulations.
However, both linear and angular friction forces are enabled.
This is done to avoid agent oscillations and destabilization in attempts to stop the movement after some maneuver.
