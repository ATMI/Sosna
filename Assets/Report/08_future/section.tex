We were able to train two agents successfully, gaining valuable experience in the environment and reward design.
However, we didn't have enough time to train the evader.
The future work would include training the evader.
We would like to try hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for the evader.
It involves three neural networks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Policy selector — determines which policy is used, either Guidance or Evasion
	\item Guidance controller — guides the agent to the target
	\item Evasion controller — prevents the collision
\end{itemize}
