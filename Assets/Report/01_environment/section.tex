Some researchers have considered 2D environments in studies on similar topics.
However, we conducted our experiments in a 3D environment, as this is the domain of the initial problem.

The environment was bounded by a sphere of fixed radius.
This was necessary to avoid the issue of agents moving too far from each other during training.
The sphere was chosen for several reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item It is one of the primitive 3D shapes.
	\item Relative coordinates inside the sphere always cover the full range in all directions, varying from -1 to 1, for example.
	This is not true for other primitives, which may affect neural network efficiency.
	\item It allows for easy collision and out-of-bounds detection.
\end{enumerate}

The environment didn't include any intentionally placed obstacles, as we focus on aircraft-aircraft collision avoidance.
