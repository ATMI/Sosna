At least two agents are required to simulate a near-collision case.
So, we have identified two possible approaches of near-collision simulation.

\subsection{Cooperative environment}\label{subsec:cooperative-environment}
All agents are of the same type and are cooperating to solve the same problem: reach the destination without collisions.
This approach has been widely studied by other researchers.

\subsection{Aggressive environment}\label{subsec:agressive-environment}
Agents of two types exist in this scenario.
Their goals are opposite, so they are constantly competing with each other:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Evader — tries to reach destination avoiding any collisions.
	\item Collider — intercepts the Evader on its way to the destination.
\end{itemize}

We opted for an aggressive environment.
Competition between the agents might lead to more interesting solutions.
Meanwhile, the agents in cooperative environment can get stuck in a local optima.
